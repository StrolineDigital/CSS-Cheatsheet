# CSS-Cheatsheet
A ground-up build of a fully responsive site that demonstrates CSS functions
## Description
The goal of this project was to demonstrate my ability to create a ground-up website with advanced CSS functionality. The goal was to create a CSS cheatsheet where the user can find helpful code snippets to use in creating a style sheet.

## Usage
The user is advised to right-click over code snippets on the website as doing so will automatically highlight them. All that is needed after that is using the appropriate keyboard shortcut (ctrl+c on windows or command+c on mac) and the snippet can be pasted into your code editor of choice.

## Credits 
Many helpful tips were found on https://stackoverflow.co/ and https://www.w3schools.com/ All code was written from scratch by Luke Stroehlein with much research involved along the way.
